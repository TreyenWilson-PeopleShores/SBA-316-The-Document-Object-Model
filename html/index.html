                </div>
                <p>In 1985, teenager Marty McFly lives in Hill Valley, California, with his depressed alcoholic mother, Lorraine; his older siblings, who are professional and social failures; and his meek father, George, who is bullied by his supervisor, Biff Tannen. After Marty's band fails a music audition, he confides in his girlfriend, Jennifer Parker, that he fears becoming like his parents despite his ambitions.

                    <p>That night, Marty meets his eccentric scientist friend, Emmett "Doc" Brown, in the Twin Pines mall parking lot. Doc unveils a time machine built from a modified DeLorean, powered by plutonium he swindled from Libyan terrorists. After Doc inputs a destination time of November 5, 1955 (the day he conceived his time travel invention), the terrorists arrive unexpectedly and gun him down. Marty flees in the DeLorean, inadvertently activating time travel when reaching 88 miles per hour (142 kilometers per hour).

                    </p>Arriving in 1955, Marty discovers he has no plutonium, so he cannot return to 1985. While exploring a burgeoning Hill Valley, Marty encounters his teenage father, discovering Biff was bullying George even then. George falls into the path of an oncoming car while spying on the teenage Lorraine changing clothes, and Marty is knocked unconscious while saving him. He wakes to find himself tended to by Lorraine, who becomes infatuated with him. Marty tracks down and convinces a younger Doc that he is from the future. Doc explains the only source available in 1955 capable of generating the 1.21 gigawatts of power required for time travel is a lightning bolt. Marty shows Doc a flyer from the future that documents an upcoming lightning strike at the town's courthouse. As Marty's siblings begin to fade from a photo he carries with him, Doc realizes Marty's actions are altering the future and jeopardizing his existence: Lorraine was supposed to tend to George instead of Marty after the car accident. Early attempts to get his parents acquainted fail, and Lorraine's infatuation with Marty deepens.

                    <p>Lorraine asks Marty to the school dance, and he plots to feign inappropriate advances on her, allowing George to intervene and rescue her, but the plan goes awry when Biff's gang locks Marty in the trunk of the performing band's car, while Biff forces himself onto Lorraine. George arrives expecting to find Marty but is assaulted by Biff. After Biff hurts Lorraine, an enraged George knocks him unconscious and escorts the grateful Lorraine to the dance. The band frees Marty from their car, but the lead guitarist injures his hand in the process, so Marty takes his place, performing while George and Lorraine share their first kiss. With his future no longer in jeopardy, Marty hurries to the courthouse to meet Doc.

                    </p>Doc discovers a letter from Marty warning him about his future and rips it up, worried about the consequences. To save Doc, Marty recalibrates the DeLorean to return ten minutes before he had left the future. The lightning strikes, sending Marty back to 1985, but the DeLorean breaks down, forcing Marty to run back to the mall. He arrives as Doc is being shot. While Marty grieves at his side, Doc sits up, revealing he had pieced Marty's note back together and is wearing a bulletproof vest. He takes Marty home and departs to 2015 in the DeLorean. Marty wakes the next morning, discovering his father is now a confident and successful science fiction author, his mother is fit and happy, his siblings are successful, and Biff is a servile valet in George's employ. As Marty reunites with Jennifer, Doc suddenly reappears in the DeLorean, insisting they return with him to the future to save their children from terrible fates.

                <p>
                    In 1899, Dr. Alexander Hartdegen is an inventor teaching at Columbia University in New York. Unlike his friend David Philby, Alex would rather do pure research than work in the business world. After a mugger kills his fiancée Emma, he devotes himself to building a time machine that will allow him to travel back in time to save her. After completing the machine in 1903, he travels back to 1899 and prevents her murder, only to see her killed again when a carriage frightens the horses of another vehicle.

                    <p>Alex realizes that any attempt to save Emma will result in her death through other circumstances. He travels to 2030 to discover whether science has discovered how to change the past. At the New York Public Library, holographic librarian Vox 114 insists time travel to the past is impossible. Alex travels to 2037 when the accidental destruction of the Moon by lunar colonists has begun rendering the Earth virtually uninhabitable. While restarting the machine, he is knocked unconscious by debris and travels forward 800,000 years to 16 July 802,701 before reawakening.

                    </p>The Earth has healed, and the human race has reverted to a Stone Age-like lifestyle. Some survivors, called "Eloi", live on the sides of cliffs of what was once Manhattan. Alex is nursed back to health by a woman named Mara, one of the few Eloi who speaks English. He observes the broken moon and realizes that maybe his teachings led to this future, just like Philby said. The same night, Alex and Mara's younger brother, Kalen, dream of a jagged-toothed face and a creature calling their name. Alex informs Mara of the dream, and she tells him they all have that dream. She then notices that his watch is missing. The next day, the Eloi are attacked by ape-like creatures called "Morlocks" who hunt them, and Mara is dragged underground along with several other Eloi. To rescue Mara, Kalen leads Alex to Vox 114, which is still functional after 800,000 years.

                   <p> After learning from Vox how to find the Morlocks, Alex enters their underground lair through an opening that resembles the face in his nightmare. He is captured and thrown into an area where Mara sits in a cage. Alex meets an intelligent, humanoid Über-Morlock, who explains that Morlocks descend from the humans who went underground after the Moon broke apart, while the Eloi evolved from those who remained on the surface. The Über-Morlocks are a group of telepaths who rule the other Morlocks, who use the Eloi as food and breeding vessels.

                    </p>The Über-Morlock explains that Alex cannot alter Emma's fate; since her death drove him to build the time machine in the first place, saving her would prevent its construction and cause a grandfather paradox. The Über-Morlock shows Alexander the time machine, returns his watch, and orders him to go home. Alex gets into the machine but pulls the Über-Morlock in, carrying them into the future as they fight. The Über-Morlock dies by rapidly aging when Alex pushes him outside of the machine's temporal bubble. Alex stops in 635,427,810, revealing a harsh, rust-colored sky over a wasteland of Morlock caves.

                    <p>Finally accepting that he cannot save Emma, Alex travels back to rescue Mara. After freeing her, he starts the machine and jams its gears with the watch, distorting time. Pursued by the Morlocks, Alex and Mara escape to the surface as the time distortion explodes, killing the Morlocks and destroying their caves and the time machine. Alex begins a new life with Mara and the Eloi, while Vox 114 helps him educate them.

                    In 1903, Philby and Mrs. Watchit, Alex's housekeeper, discuss his absence in his laboratory. Philby tells Mrs. Watchit he is glad Alex has gone to a place where he can find peace, and Philby would like to hire her as a housekeeper. She accepts until Alex returns, but then privately bids Alex farewell. Philby leaves, looking toward the laboratory affectionately, then proudly throws his bowler hat away in tribute to Alex's objection to blind conformity.
